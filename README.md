<h1>**Data Analysis and Machine Learning Repository**</h1>


**Overview**
Welcome to the Air Quality Analysis and Machine Learning Repository! This repository hosts a collection of projects related to air quality data analysis and machine learning. The projects included focus on exploratory data analysis (EDA), classification algorithms, and various machine learning techniques applied to air quality datasets.

**Projects**
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** :The EDA project delves into a comprehensive analysis of air quality data. It explores key statistical metrics, visualizations, and trends within the dataset. Insights gained from this exploratory phase lay the foundation for subsequent machine learning endeavors.

- **Classification Algorithms**
The Classification Algorithms project aims to predict specific air quality categories based on historical data. It employs various classification techniques to identify patterns and relationships within the dataset. The goal is to develop models that accurately classify air quality conditions, facilitating early detection and intervention.

- **Machine Learning Algorithms**
The broader Machine Learning Algorithms project encompasses a range of techniques applied to air quality data. This includes regression models, clustering algorithms, and other advanced machine learning approaches. The objective is to uncover nuanced patterns and relationships within the data, contributing to a deeper understanding of air quality dynamics.

**Getting Started**
For each project, you can find detailed instructions on setting up and running the analyses. Dependencies, dataset information, and specific project goals are outlined in individual project directories.
